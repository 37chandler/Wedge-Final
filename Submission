## Query Comparison Results

Fill in the following table with the results from the 
queries contained in `gbq_assessment_query.sql`. You only
need to fill in relative difference on the rows where it applies. 
When calculating relative difference, use the formula 
` (your_results - john_results)/john_results)`.

The wedge project felt like a very unstructured project, which is not a good thing in my opinion. It would have been nice to have a little more structure and guidence on something in retrospect seems like a basic and fundementall skill. Unstanding how to upload data in a cloud storage setting to utilize for later is fine and great to recognize, but more structure and guided rescources could have opened up a door for a grander project, like data streaming, which would have helped add to the competitive advantage of chooisng graduate school over a self taught approach. Stress levels were very high during this process but once everything started running and loading they did drop in a big way. One of the shining features from this project was the encouragment from new life long friends to keep working hard and to not give up, for that I am truly grateful and it made it fun to bash my head against a wall as I struggled; this also helped with my mental health which felt like it was at an all time low this semester. Over all I would rate the wedge project a 7 out of 10. I feel if there was more guided structure to the big picture of the wedge it can open it up to something far greater than would be expected to come out of the Univeristy of Montana.
