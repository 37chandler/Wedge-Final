Matt, you really need to start paying attention to things like file names. Your submission file is missing the `.md`, which means it can't be rendered by github. Plus you have a slightly different naming convention for your files (extra space in #2). Those periods inside the file name will cause havoc on some systems. 

It's a bummer you didn't fill in the submission table and do the comparisons that were asked for so that we could compare results. 

I appreciate the desire for more structure, a refrain you've mentioned several times in the class. You would have really disliked the previous version of this project which was much more open ended, in line with real world projects. You're in graduate school, so now is the time to build those muscles of supplying your _own_ structure to a project, rather than requiring someone in a position of authority to give it to you. You've made lots of progress on the coding across the course of the semester, maybe the big-picture project leadership is the next tool to add to the toolbox. 

### Task 1

This looks like just a partial submission, unless you manually changed the file names for each file. The point, of course, is to do this programmatically.

### Task 2

Nice work on this. Doesn't get much more efficient. It'd be nice to clean up the notebook.

### Task 3

This is also partial. Not clear where you're getting the data from and you don't mention it in the submission. The code you have looks good, but you need the data to run the code against.
