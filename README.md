# Wedge-Final

The Wedge Co-Op is the largest co-operative grocery store in the US and recides in Minneapolis, MN. Thanks to a partnership with the grocery store, we have data dating back to January 1, 2012 from the point-of-sale system, developed by the Wedge. We have data through January 2017. The system logs every row from every receipt. With some missing information to create a more precise analysis, based on spoilage and other bottom line variables, it is still a fantastic data set based opn transactions. This is due to the wedge being co-op'd owned. The public is welcome to shop there, but membership is lightweight: $80 (which can be paid in installments) buys you shares which entitle you to $3.75 off per month, other Member discounts, and annual refunds based on business profitability, following similar large box stores
